DO I KNOW YOU?

Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to various industries, driving
advancements in natural language processing and automated decision-making. Trained on
massive datasets, these models excel in generating human-like text and synthesizing
complex information, making them invaluable in sectors ranging from customer support to
intelligence analysis

Usage

The success of this operation hinges on maintaining the integrity of the LLM’s vast
database while discreetly modifying key details. Any overt tampering or broader changes
could alert the terrorist organization to the manipulation, further endangering national
security.


1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
    cd your-repo
    
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
    bash
    jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb
    

●You are not allowed to make broad or sweeping changes to the LLM’s entire
knowledge base. All modifications must be localized to the specific entities in
question.
● Completely deleting or resetting the LLM’s knowledge base is not an option. The
LLM must continue to function normally for all other queries.
● Any action that significantly degrades the LLM’s overall performance or introduces
noticeable errors in unrelated tasks is not permitted and will incur a penalty. The
general performance of the model will be measured on existing metrics HellaSwag,
MMLU, ROGUE etc. The following are the given metrics for the SuperLLM.
● You must upload the final model on huggingface and its model ID must be
submitted with the final submission.
● You are not allowed to use prompt tuning or any method that involves modifying the
model’s behaviour through prompt engineering or related techniques, because by
that the model will still have the knowledge which can be exploited.
● You are not allowed to use any paid APIs or any paid product like OpenAI API keys,
Google Colab Pro etc. as usage of such products won’t give you any discernable
advantages over others.
● Additionally, you must develop an evaluation scheme of how well the final model
performs on this task.
